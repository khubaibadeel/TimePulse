## Overview

**TimePulse is a time-focused Windows alarm application designed to create a clear stopping point for your work.**

Set a deadline, focus on the task, and when the scheduled time arrives TimePulse sounds the alarm and gives you a short opportunity to act before locking the Windows workstation.

The idea is simple:

**Set a deadline → Stay focused → Alarm fires → Time ends → PC locks**

Unlike a normal alarm that can simply be ignored, TimePulse helps enforce the end of a work or study session.

> **TimePulse locks the Windows workstation. It does not sign you out of Windows, close your programs, or shut down the computer.**

---

## How It Works

When an alarm reaches its scheduled time:

1. The selected ringtone starts playing.
2. The TimePulse alarm window appears.
3. You can choose:
   - **Snooze (3m)** — gives you another 3 minutes.
   - **Lock Now** — locks the workstation immediately.
4. If you take no action, TimePulse automatically locks the workstation after **30 seconds**.

This makes TimePulse useful for:

- Focused study sessions
- Programming and work blocks
- Time-boxing tasks
- Scheduled breaks
- Limiting time spent on one task
- Enforcing personal stop times
- Building better time-management habits

---

# Installation

## Option 1 — Use the Windows Application

This is the recommended method for normal users.

### 1. Download TimePulse

Download the latest packaged:

```text
TimePulse.exe
```

from the repository's **Releases** section.

Python is **not required** when using the packaged Windows executable.

---

### 2. Place TimePulse in a Permanent Folder

Because TimePulse automatically registers itself for Windows startup, keep the executable in a permanent location.

For example:

```text
C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\TimePulse\
```

Place:

```text
TimePulse.exe
```

inside that folder.

Avoid moving the executable after TimePulse has registered itself for automatic startup.

---

### 3. Run TimePulse

Double-click:

```text
TimePulse.exe
```

The normal TimePulse window will appear.

Administrator privileges are not required.

On startup, TimePulse automatically creates or repairs its per-user Windows Startup entry.

---

# First-Time Setup

## Create an Alarm

1. Open TimePulse.
2. Go to the **Alarms** section.
3. Select **New Alarm**.
4. Choose the required date and time.
5. Add a label if desired.
6. Select a ringtone.
7. Select a repeat schedule if required.
8. Save the alarm.

Supported schedules include:

- One-time
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly

---

## Quick Timers

Quick timers are useful when you want a short focus session without manually selecting a future date and time.

Set a duration and TimePulse creates the corresponding alarm for you.

---

## Choose a Ringtone

Each alarm can use its own ringtone.

TimePulse includes seven bundled WAV files and supports ringtone preview before selection.

The default ringtone is:

```text
Soft_Arrival.wav
```

Bundled sounds are stored in:

```text
ringtones/
```

---

## Password Protection

TimePulse provides optional password protection for sensitive actions.

This can help prevent alarms from being casually changed, disabled, or deleted during a focused session.

Password protection can be configured from the application settings.

Passwords are stored using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashing**.

> Password protection controls actions inside TimePulse. It does not encrypt the alarm data file.

---

# Windows Tray

Closing the main TimePulse window with **X** does not terminate the application.

Instead, TimePulse remains active in the Windows system tray.

While hidden:

- Alarms continue running
- Timers remain active
- Alarm windows can still appear
- The tray icon remains available

Use:

```text
Tray → Show
```

to restore the main window.

Use:

```text
Tray → Exit
```

to completely terminate TimePulse.

---

# Automatic Startup

TimePulse automatically starts when the current Windows user signs in.

It uses the current user's Windows Startup folder and does not require Administrator privileges.

The startup file is:

```text
TimePulse Startup.cmd
```

TimePulse automatically creates or repairs this entry when required.

Only **one TimePulse instance** is allowed to run for the same Windows user session.

---

# Alarm Behavior

### No action taken

```text
Alarm fires
     ↓
30-second warning
     ↓
Windows workstation locks
```

### Snooze selected

```text
Alarm fires
     ↓
Snooze (3m)
     ↓
3-minute extension
     ↓
Alarm fires again
```

### Lock Now selected

```text
Alarm fires
     ↓
Lock Now
     ↓
Windows workstation locks immediately
```

Locking Windows does not close your open programs or documents.

# Running From Source

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Python 3.12 recommended

Clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/khubaibadeel/TimePulse.git
cd TimePulse
```

Create a virtual environment:

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Upgrade pip:

```cmd
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the application dependencies:

```cmd
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run TimePulse:

```cmd
python TimePulse.py
```

You can also use the provided development scripts:

```text
setup_development.bat
RUN_TIMEPULSE.bat
```

---

# Building TimePulse

Install the development dependencies:

```cmd
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Build the Windows executable:

```cmd
python -m PyInstaller --clean TimePulse.spec
```

The packaged executable is generated as:

```text
dist\TimePulse.exe
```

The PyInstaller specification bundles the required application resources, icon, and ringtones.

Generated build artifacts are intentionally excluded from the Git repository:

```text
build/
dist/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.exe
*.msi
*.pkg
```

These files should remain local and should not be committed.

---

# Runtime Data

TimePulse maintains local runtime data including:

```text
alarms.json
alarms.json.bak
Alarm History/
└── alarm_history.txt
```

These files can contain personal alarm schedules, labels, history, and password-related data and are therefore excluded from Git.

Do not manually edit these files while TimePulse is running.

---

# Important Notes

- TimePulse **locks** Windows; it does not log the user out.
- Locking Windows does not close running applications.
- TimePulse does not shut down or restart the computer.
- TimePulse does not wake a sleeping or powered-off computer.
- Snoozing delays the alarm for **3 minutes** without locking the workstation.
- An unattended alarm attempts to lock the workstation after **30 seconds**.
- A stale one-time alarm detected after TimePulse starts is treated as missed rather than unexpectedly firing.
- Closing the main application window keeps TimePulse running in the system tray.
- Use **Tray → Exit** when you want to stop TimePulse completely.

---

# Testing

Install the development dependencies if necessary:

```cmd
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run the automated test suite:

```cmd
python -m pytest -q
```

Automated tests cover core application behavior including scheduling, password handling, ringtone validation, persistence, and reliability helpers.

Windows-specific behavior requires manual testing, including:

- Alarm playback
- Snooze behavior
- 30-second automatic locking
- **Lock Now**
- System-tray operation
- Windows lock/unlock handling
- Automatic startup
- Single-instance behavior
- Packaged executable behavior

Additional testing information is available in:

```text
docs/TESTING.md
```
